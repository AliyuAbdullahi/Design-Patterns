#Singleton Design Pattern

Sometimes it’s important for some classes to have exactly one instance. There are many objects we only need one instance of them and if we, instantiate more than one,
we’ll run into all sorts of problems like incorrect program behavior, overuse of resources, or inconsistent results.

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
