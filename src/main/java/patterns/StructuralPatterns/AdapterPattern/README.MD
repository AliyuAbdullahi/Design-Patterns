#Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter pattern lets you to adapt what an object or a class exposes to what another object or class expects.

From sample code, there is a 2 points (positive/negative) wire, 2 points socket, 3 points wire(positive, negative, earth)
3 points socket and a ```SocketAdapter``` that can adapt a 2 point wire to 3 point socket and vice versa.
